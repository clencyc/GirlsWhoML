       In a small clinic outside Bhopal, a faint heartbeat flickers on a screen. An expectant mother watches an AI-powered prenatal app translate data into reassurance, it reads in her language: Hindi.
Across India, women from Gurgaon to rural Haryana use digital tools to track pregnancies, detect illness, and consult doctors remotely. 

“This digital leap is improving outcomes for women who once had almost no access to timely care,” says Shivangi, a health worker. Yet she knows progress must be fair. “Bias still lingers in the code, where cardiology algorithms misread women’s hearts,” she explains. “Progress means nothing if the data forgets who we are.”

Healthcare AI needs training data that includes diverse populations of women and minorities whose bodies have been medical afterthoughts for too long. We need algorithms that recognise hormonal cycles, pain patterns, and maternal health needs. That stops dismissing symptoms as "probably stress."
Her dream is simple yet radical: a world where her daughter’s body and voice are design priorities, not afterthoughts.

      For decades, conditions like endometriosis and uterine fibroids were medical afterthoughts. Mental health and reproductive care? Even further behind. Women's pain was dismissed, their cycles ignored, and their maternal needs sidelined.
But technology is beginning to listen.
Across India and Pakistan, AI-powered healthcare apps now offer virtual checkups, pregnancy guidance, and early disease detection, bridging gaps that geography and bias created. In rural villages, a woman's body speaks a language healthcare has never learned to hear.
"Most women in rural Pakistan don't have internet access," says Neel, a 32-year-old student. "Period trackers, location sharing, telehealth—these aren't luxuries. They're safety nets we've never had."
Natasha and Angelica, health advocates, dream bigger: AI that recognises hormonal cycles, understands maternal health patterns, and stops dismissing symptoms as "probably stress." Healthcare designed by women, for women—not as an afterthought, but as the foundation.
The WHO calls it digital health equity. Women call it long overdue.
The question isn't whether AI can transform women's healthcare. It's whether we'll finally let women design the algorithms that understand their bodies—or keep building systems that were never meant to see them clearly.

Some time ago, her face was used to create nude images, and everyone believed those nudes were real. It's hampering everyone's privacy." A strong weapon with no guardrail can do more harm than good.

"I'm not very hopeful about AI as a woman,” a girl from Patna shared, reflecting on her witnessed experience of how rural women are especially targeted towards the misuse of AI, particularly with image generation, creating sexual content and blackmailing women. It is widely used to make negative content around women, and from the viewers' side, this is getting more reac,h too.

Just like Instagram AI trend reels go viral, awareness-related videos should also be popularly available so they reach everyone. From farmers to illiterate women and men in rural villages of India who don't have much digital knowledge often tend to become victims. They are not aware of security and privacy, so having proper educational content to raise awareness will help boost confidence, and they, too, will move forward with AI.
It’s high time the government runs programs to raise awareness about security concerns related to AI. Global AI policy guidelines shall be determined, with every country setting laws of punishment (fine or imprisonment) for committing crimes related to the misuse of AI. Special international laws are needed to put a check on how the data collected from the masses is actually used by these AI companies, and if the users have given consent to use their private information for training the Machine Learning Models. 

The same AI that can bring a smile amidst loss and grief can also be the reason for someone to end their life. The final call to use it is always in the hands of humans, not machines. So while making these systems, we shall be thinking like humans, not machines. `},

From her experience lately, she also shares how AI is rapidly killing journalism because it has replaced scriptwriters. With just a few words, you get scripts written and thumbnails ready, but the responses are very fabricated. This is ending realistic human output, especially in journalism.
AI creating images from news boardrooms has even led to the decline of field reporting and field reporter roles. This has ended humans' potential to think critically. People just pick up their phones and start scrolling. They don't make an effort anymore, don't try to go where incidents are happening. Everything is available sitting at home.
This has eliminated employment opportunities for so many people, or their minds have just shrunk. People can't think deeply anymore.
"People think AI is taking you one step forward when in reality it is taking you two steps backwards.”

Every story has a beginning, and here, it often starts with fear of the mysterious buttons. Women in homes across India and neighbours across the region treated smartphones like ticking bombs. Shivangi, a girl from India shared: “My grandmother believed if she pressed the wrong button, the 'machine' would call Modi directly. So, she kept her distance…”


For weeks, the phone sat on the table like a museum piece. It was cleaned, admired, charged, but never touched. And then came the magic moment, the moment technology stopped being foreign and became personal. Someone casually mentioned, “You know, YouTube can show bhajans whenever you want.” Instant transformation. Fear evaporated. Curiosity took over. Within days, the same grandmother became, Shivangi  proudly said, “The streaming queen.”


She started subscribing to channels and adjusting video quality. The woman who once hid from the phone was now teaching others how to use it. 


It turns out, new technology isn’t intimidating when it speaks the language of daily life. When it helps with recipes, bills, devotion, children’s homework, or simply staying connected, mothers learn tech faster than anyone expects.

       In post-conflict Kurdistan, Iraq, technology became something unexpectedو and a rebuilding tool that opened doors faster than physical infrastructure could. A 26-year-old youth activist there watched digital education do what traditional systems couldn't: give women immediate access to skills, markets, and voices beyond borders.

“AI could help women access training in digital skills, entrepreneurship, and remote work, especially in areas where opportunities are limited.” - Resa, Kurdistan

In Kurdistan, women didn't wait for perfect conditions. They used what was available, smartphones, online platforms, to create pathways that geography and recent history tried to limit.
This pattern echoes across communities rebuilding in different ways. In Ethiopia, women navigate similar transitions. In rural India and Pakistan, different barriers create a similar hunger for access.

But something shifts when a girl in Punjab can learn the same coding course as someone in Silicon Valley. When an Ethiopian woman accesses the same business training as her urban counterpart. When a Pakistani teenager finds the same resources, regardless of the men around her controlling physical access. When a woman in Kurdistan can mentor or learn from someone continent.


Digital platforms don't erase inequality; infrastructure gaps persist. But they create possibilities that weren't there before. For women in communities rebuilding or breaking through traditional limitations, technology is transformational.
Geography used to be destiny. Now it's just a starting point.

Her earliest memory of technology is of a woman at the front of a classroom - teaching computers with confidence and warmth. “We assumed she was an expert simply because she was a woman teaching computers,” Ann Marie laughs. But that assumption planted something deep in her: the idea that visibility matters.
Years later, Ann Marie works in AI design and ethics. She builds tools meant to empower, not exploit. “AI can do amazing things,” she says, “but if empathy isn’t part of the process, we end up with innovation that excludes the very people it should serve.” She often thinks of that teacher - standing before a room of unsure students, turning hesitation into hope. It reminds her that technology doesn’t just need intelligence; it needs heart. The woman who once taught her to press “save” taught her something far greater - that progress must never come at the cost of compassion.

Peer teachers in the research group describe similar outcomes where rural girls who struggled with spelling suddenly mastered vocabulary; shy children excelled at quizzes generated just for them.

On the city’s outskirts, new server farms hum night and day, cooling thousands of GPUs running AI models that most of the town’s residents will never use.

  'story': `When you step in, the light feels different. It flickers above us, but what shines is within each of us, says Miriam, a young mother from Lusaka. On Sunday evenings, women gather beneath a single roof, some just learning to type, others showing nervous laughter before pressing a key. They call themselves The Circle of Light.
“For me, using a laptop was always something only teachers or big officials did. Now, I can send pictures of what I make—bracelets, mats—to other women in the group. They teach me, I teach them. Sometimes we forget who’s the student and who’s the teacher.”
In a region where only one in four women has steady internet, the act of learning basic digital skills is revolutionary. Miriam and her peers have begun forming WhatsApp groups to sell crafts, draft messages, and upload photos. The small triumphs add up—a new sale, a message typed without hesitation.
“As we learn together, the fear goes.” The settlement echoes with laughter and the beeping of keys. “This computer,” she says, “is not just a box—it’s a mirror. We see what we might become.”
Government programs like India’s PMGDISHA and the Smart Village Initiative in Zambia are bringing digital tools to women at local levels, but Miriam believes the real change comes from within communities. “You have to trust us to lead. These gatherings are the start of something big, if only others would listen.”
Her hope is shared: that officials and organisations see small digital circles not just as learners, but as leaders—pioneers of digital democracy, where every woman grows strong and helps others do the same.

  'story': `Afiwa Mensah rises before sunrise in her village in northern Ghana. Every evening, as the sky dims and the heat fades, she gathers with her daughter and neighbours beneath an old acacia tree. The sound of children’s laughter mixes with the quiet tap of solar-powered tablets waking up to life. Before, seasons were ruled by guessing at the sky, by the wisdom passed down in stories and long meetings.
The first time Afiwa touched the weather mapping app, her hands shook. She worried she’d break something. But her daughter grinned, showed her how to swipe, how to open the rainfall map. “Now, the land talks to me through data,” Afiwa says. The meetings under the tree transformed. “We plan together: planting, how much water, sharing updates by message with women in other villages. Some nights, even my mother—who never learned to read—sends voice notes to her sisters. The children listen, sometimes helping with the buttons.”
Harvests grew steadier. Losses from droughts became rare. Everyone in the group has a story—the neighbour who saved her yams after a surprise storm, the grandmother who now tells stories while sending messages on her tablet. “We aren’t alone with technology. We use old stories and new screens together,” Afiwa smiles. “People help each other with both.”
It’s more than farming; it’s survival and solidarity. Community rituals mixed with something new—a confidence that tomorrow can be planned, not just prayed for. “Digital connection is our seed, and community is our rain,” Afiwa says.
Their wish is clear: “Let governments and organizations come listen to us before they drop off devices and leave. We want training, apps that speak our languages, tools that fit our real lives.” In this village, the future of agriculture is as much about heart and togetherness as about data and screens.

  'story': `“When women build the systems, technology listens better,” says Sarah Forrest, an AI advisor and computer science graduate student from Massachusetts. Her earliest tech memories are shaped by helping her grandmother with college assignments at age 50 and teaching herself to troubleshoot family finances. “Technology became my entry point to a wider world—a way to connect beyond what we could see.”
Sarah spends evenings running community workshops for women and caregivers, where the aim is not just to teach code, but to build digital confidence. “Bias isn’t a bug—it’s who’s not in the room. When women, people from marginalised backgrounds, or those with caregiving roles co-design digital safety and privacy, the whole system shifts.”
Across stories in your research, women echo this: empathy is as essential as intelligence. “I want AI to act as a bridge, not a barrier—detecting harassment, amplifying unheard stories, and ensuring everyone can find mentorship, care, and opportunity,” writes Kangkana Barman from Assam. OECD findings show that diverse design teams reduce AI bias by 25% and drive greater user trust. “True innovation isn’t just efficiency—it’s belonging, rooted in care,” Sarah adds.
Sarah’s hope: “The next generation of AI must remember what makes us human. Our belonging starts with who holds a seat at the table. That’s what transforms technology from a tool into an ally.”

  'story': `Kimberly’s story begins in the soft hum of a library computer lab, long before Wi-Fi was everywhere. “I used to spend hours printing pages to take home,” she says. Her grandmother, who started college at fifty, would wait patiently beside her, asking how to type her name. Those evenings were full of laughter and learning, two generations discovering technology together.
For Kimberly, that space became her first classroom in self-reliance. As a first-generation college student, she soon found herself fixing neighbours’ laptops, teaching others how to send emails, and setting up online accounts for those who feared “breaking the internet.” These small acts were more than technical help - they were steps toward empowerment.
Now, Kimberly teaches AI literacy to women in underserved communities. To her, entrepreneurship isn’t just about creating businesses; it’s about creating access. It’s about using what you know to lift others higher. The same girl who once helped her grandmother type essays now helps others find their digital voice. What started as love became a legacy.

{ id: "r24", theme:'Values', answer: `The Voice That Answered Back`, name: "Saima Malik", occupation: "Technology Activist, Bangladesh" , 'image': 'saima_malik.jpg',
  'story': `She remembers the first time her mother spoke to a phone — not to someone on the other end, but to the device itself.

 “Show me pictures,” her mother said, and the phone obeyed. It was a quiet moment, but something shifted. A woman who once waited for help to search or scroll suddenly realised she could ask, and the world would answer back.
Years later, her daughter is studying computer science, designing the very systems that now listen to millions of voices. For her, technology isn’t just convenience, it’s confidence made visible.

She sees how AI gives women in her community access to education, safety, and independence, but she also feels the shadows of privacy breaches and deepfakes.
Still, her vision is tender and fierce: AI that “assists like a friend,” that motivates, listens, and gives comfort. A world where no one is divided by wealth or class, where compassion sits at the core of every algorithm.
 When she codes, she remembers that first voice command, the courage it took to ask a question out lou,d and she builds for that same courage in others.
